## 🙏 Credits

This project was developed as part of a mini-task submission during my internship at **BlockseBlock**. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team at BlockseBlock for the opportunity to explore, compare, and analyze key blockchain platforms — Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and R3 Corda — through a structured report that deepened my understanding of real-world blockchain architectures and their unique design philosophies.
